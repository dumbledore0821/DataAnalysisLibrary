* A summary of the project
abstract:

This project was done as a final project for an introductory computer science course. It contains a library of data visualization 
functions that are able to take a .csv file from command line and plot it. It is able to print summary statistics onto the plot 
itself and draw a linear regression line onto the plot. The plots that are drawn will therefore have the appropriate title, 
coordinate axes, axes labels, the data points, descriptive statistics, and a linear regression line. These functions are all wrapped 
together in a single plot() function, and are implemented using various functions within StdDraw library. This project may benefit 
from possible improvements such as a more pleasing graphical display of the data, as well as the inclusion of larger datasets.
