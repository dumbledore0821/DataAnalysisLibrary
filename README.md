This project contains a library of data visualization functions that are able to take a .csv file from command line and 
plot it. It is able to print summary statistics onto the plot itself and draw a linear regression line onto the plot. The
plots that are drawn will therefore have the appropriate title, coordinate axes, axes labels, the data points, descriptive
statistics, and a linear regression line. These functions are all wrapped together in a single plot() function, and are 
implemented using various functions within StdDraw library.
